Thus by controlling the size of this group we can modulate the propagation speed. However, the restrictions of this kind has to be aligned with a delicate balance between the social and political implications. Thus epidemiologists and government consuls has to deduce a policy accordingly. That is, balance between the cost and profit of limit the size of meetings. TODO list.

Thus letting a partition of one according to the risk we define the closed loop policy \\[\\begin{equation} u_{\\beta} = u_{\\beta} (C) := \\begin{cases} u_{\\beta} ^ 1, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_0 \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{\\beta} ^ i, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_{i-1} \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{\\beta} ^ n, &amp; \\text{if } C \\geq \\pi_n \\end{cases} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} u_{\\beta} ^ i \\in [0, 1], \\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^ n u_{\\beta} ^ {i} =1 \\end{equation}\\] For example, Mexico has been aligned with strategies following the analogy of a traffic light. That is, according to the number of confirmed reported cases and other calculations regarding with the instant reproductive number \\(R_t\\), the level risk is classified as green, yellow, orange or red. Thus, according to this stratification, the health consult recommends a certain set of protocols. Hence, in the following we consider the control defined on (3.3) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} u_{\\beta} (C) &amp;:= u_{\\beta} ^ i, \\qquad \\text{if } \\pi_{i-1} \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ i &amp; \\in \\{ \\text{green, yellow, ambar, orange, red}\\} \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] "],["numerical-results.html", "4 Numerical Results", " 4 Numerical Results Here are the numerical evidence of our argument.
