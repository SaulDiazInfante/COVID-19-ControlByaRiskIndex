By controlling the size of meetings, we can mitigate the propagation new infections. However, this sort of restrictions has to be aligned with a delicate balance between the social and political implications. Then epidemiologists and government consuls has to deduce a policy accordingly. That is, balance between the cost and profit of limit the size of meetings. TODO list. "],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction This section is an overview of the methods that we propose to solve an important problem.

"],["model-forumulation.html", "3 Model forumulation 3.1 Functional Cost", " 3 Model forumulation Our formulation without control reads \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} S^{\\prime} (t)&amp;= \\mu N - \\lambda_f S - (\\phi + \\mu) S + \\omega V + \\theta R \\\\ I ^{\\prime} (t) &amp;= \\lambda_f S + (1 - \\sigma) \\lambda_f V - (\\gamma + \\mu ) I \\\\ V ^{\\prime} (t) &amp;= \\phi S - (1 - \\sigma) \\lambda_f V - (\\omega + \\mu) V \\\\ R ^{\\prime} (t) &amp;= \\gamma I - (\\theta + \\mu) R \\\\ \\frac{dC}{dt} &amp;= \\frac{\\kappa}{N-I} (1 - C) I^{\\prime}(t) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] With force infection \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_f := \\left[ \\left( 1 + a \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{365} t \\right) \\beta_0 \\right) \\right] \\frac{I (1 - C)}{N}. \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Here we describe the risk of acquire the virus in a meeting by the state \\(C(t)\\). Note that the ratio \\(\\frac{I}{N}\\) denotes the probability that a susceptible has a potential contract with a infected individual. Thus \\((1 - \\frac{I}{N})\\) is the contact probability that a infected encounters with a suceptible. Thus, in a gather of \\(k\\) individuals, \\[ C(t):= 1 -\\left(1 - \\frac{I(t)}{N} \\right)^k, \\] describe the probability that a susceptible suffer a contact with a infected in a gather of k individuals, in other words, this expression quantify the risk of contagious in meetings of k individuals. To describe epidemic protocols about number the size of a gathering— the number of individuals in a meeting—we describe policies assuming that a decision maker choose an strategy each week from a finite and countable set of actions. Thus letting a partition of one according to the risk we define the closed loop policy \\[\\begin{equation} u_{\\beta} = u_{\\beta} (C) := \\begin{cases} u_{\\beta} ^ 1, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_0 \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{\\beta} ^ i, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_{i-1} \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{\\beta} ^ n, &amp; \\text{if } C \\geq \\pi_n \\end{cases} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} u_{\\beta} ^ i \\in [0, 1], \\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^ n u_{\\beta} ^ {i} =1 \\end{equation}\\] For example, Mexico has been aligned with strategies following the analogy of a traffic light. That is, according to the number of confirmed reported cases and other calculations regarding with the instant reproductive number \\(R_t\\), the level risk is classified as green, yellow, orange or red. Thus, according to this stratification, the health consult recommends a certain set of protocols. Hence, in the following we consider the control defined on (3.3) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} u_{\\beta} (C) &amp;:= u_{\\beta} ^ i, \\qquad \\text{if } \\pi_{i-1} \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ i &amp; \\in \\{ \\text{green, yellow, ambar, orange, red}\\} \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] This control function \\(u_\\beta\\), encloses non-pharmaceutical measures like health-distance, mask-wearing, mobility reduction, among others. Here we assume that its implementation reduce transmission rate accordingly to (3.3). Since the aim if this papper is evaluate the effect of restrict the size of gatterings–also aligned with the different risk of levels— we postulated the following control to modulate the size of meets. \\[\\begin{equation} u_{k} (C) := \\begin{cases} u_{k} ^ 1, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_0 \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{k} ^ i, &amp; \\text{if } \\pi_{i-1} \\leq C \\leq \\pi_i \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{k} ^ n, &amp; \\text{if } C \\geq \\pi_n \\end{cases} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] 3.1 Functional Cost Because our aim is to balance the epidemiological protocols with the economic implications, we propose a functional cost that penalize the implication of the meting restrictions but minimizing the years of life lost accumulated by death or disability due to SARS-CoV-2. Let \\(a_{I_S}, a_{I_D}\\) weight to quantify the cost due to the number of accumulated confirmed cases and deaths—here we assume that this indicator is proportional to the prevalence. Denote by \\(b_{\\beta}\\), \\(b_{k}\\) constants to weight the cost due to the restrictions. Then our functional reads \\[ J(Y_{I}, u_\\beta, u_k): = \\int_{0}^T (a_{I} + a_{D}) Y_{I}(r) + a_{\\beta} u_{\\beta}^2(r) + a_k u_k^2(r) dr. \\] "],["numerical-results.html", "4 Numerical Results", " 4 Numerical Results Here are the numerical evidence of our argument. # TODO: put here the plotly figure code with # a load data block library(deSolve) library(rjson) library(reshape2) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(tidyquant) ## Loading required package: lubridate ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lubridate&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## date, intersect, setdiff, union ## Loading required package: PerformanceAnalytics ## Loading required package: xts ## Loading required package: zoo ## ## Attaching package: &#39;zoo&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## as.Date, as.Date.numeric ## ## Attaching package: &#39;xts&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## first, last ## ## Attaching package: &#39;PerformanceAnalytics&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:graphics&#39;: ## ## legend ## Loading required package: quantmod ## Loading required package: TTR ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;quantmod&#39;: ## method from ## as.zoo.data.frame zoo ## ══ Need to Learn tidyquant? ════════════════════════════════════════════════════ ## Business Science offers a 1-hour course - Learning Lab #9: Performance Analysis &amp; Portfolio Optimization with tidyquant! ## &lt;/&gt; Learn more at: https://university.business-science.io/p/learning-labs-pro &lt;/&gt; library(plotly) ## Loading required package: ggplot2 ## ## Attaching package: &#39;plotly&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: ## ## last_plot ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:graphics&#39;: ## ## layout library(classInt) library(&quot;styler&quot;) library(lubridate) # "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
