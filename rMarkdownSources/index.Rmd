# Abstract {-}

  Argument:
  The number of individual in a gathering could play an important
  role for control the spread of COVID-19. By controlling the size of
  meetings, we can mitigate the propagation new infections. However, 
  this sort of restrictions has to be aligned with a delicate balance 
  between the social and political implications. Then epidemiologists 
  and government consuls has to deduce a policy accordingly.
  That is, balance between the cost and profit
  of limit the size of meetings and restrictions that affect the 
  mobility, mask wearing and others NPIs .
  
TODO list.
